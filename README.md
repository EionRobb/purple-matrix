# purple-matrix

This project is a plugin for
[libpurple](https://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/WhatIsLibpurple) which adds the
ability to communicate with [matrix.org](http://matrix.org) homeservers to any
libpurple-based clients (such as [Pidgin](http://www.pidgin.im)).

# Installation

Using this on Linux should be as simple as:

```
make
sudo make install
```

You will then need to restart Pidgin, after which you should be able to add a
'Matrix' account.
